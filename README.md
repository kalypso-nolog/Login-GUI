# Login-GUI Made by kalypso-nolog as a training code
A new ctk project made by me, showing a login page using the library "Customtkinter", it's a practice so there might be somes things to review but i enjoyed making this.
You obviously can use it as a base to a new code or continue yourself but it may be thanksful if you could put my github in or maybe things like that.
If you got any questions i can answer but I am maybe not good as you will think so just enjoy this and if you got any comments to help me or something like that, do it.
